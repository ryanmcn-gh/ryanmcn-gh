# Introduction

Hi, I’m @ryanmcn-gh, I'm beginning to learn programming having come from an engineering background. 

I’m interested in building on my knowledge of C# while also learning more JS through beginner projects. I think my first repo will involve building a simple countdown timer using JS and implementing this as a Chrome Extension. 

Experience so far:- 

- 6+ months experience with C# fundamentals. 
- Beginner with HTML, CSS and JS.
- Some experience using relational DBMS such as MSSM and Access. 
- Some experience using MATLAB.
- Some experience with web applications, web services and desktop applications.
